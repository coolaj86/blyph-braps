Hey,

Brian and I just wanted to let you know that we've updated all of the
books you listed on Blyph in Fall semester as available for trade for
Winter semester.

Get the trades rolling by telling us the books you need for next semester.

First check your BYU booklist
http://booklist.byu.edu/mybooklist

Then sign in to Blyph
http://blyph.com

Now search by Title or ISBN and list books as Needed or for Trade.


**Upcoming Events**

Decemember 12th to 17th: Sell Back Your Books

If you prefer to sell your books rather than trade them, now is
the best time to get your best value.
Check online stores through Blyph.com and the BYU Bookstore.


January 3rd (12-2pm0: Book Swap at BYU Brigham Square

For those of you that want to get your books early, list your books
on Blyph and schedule the meetup with other students on campus.


January 6th to 13th: Trade it up.

Some of you like to wait to find out whether the teacher will actually use
the books they've listed before you purchase them. That's smart! By trading local
you can wait until the last minute and stil get the books you need without
the hassle of shipping.



Remember **more people** means **more trading** matches and **lower costs**.
