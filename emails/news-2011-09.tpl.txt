Hey guys,

We've been listening to your feedback and we're meeting your demands:

 * We've greatly enhanced the book lister to be much easier to use.
 * We've scratched the book reimbursement in favor of a 16gb iPad2 giveaway.

If you've listed books, but haven't tagged them as 'Have' or 'Need', *please* do so. We've got *hundreds* of books listed, but we can't finish making the matches until we know who wants them. So get on that!

We've been pulling some late-nighters (3am, y'know, no big deal) to get the matching service up ASAP.
We expect that you will be able to see your matches and start trades on Saturday.

As always, your biggest help will be to share Blyph with your friends, frenemies, and the like.

Remember: Sharing == More Trades AND Sharing == iPad. 'nuff said
