<h1>The Sweepstakes!</h1>

<p><strong>One student</strong> will be awarded a shiney new 16gb iPad2 in a random drawing, courtesy of Blyph LLC. The drawing is subject to the following conditions:</p>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<h2>Conditions and Legal Blah Blah:</h2>

<h3>Entering:</h3>

<p>Enter your email address and school URL into the Blyph Books website.</p> 

<p>Be a full time student registered at BYU (including the ELC).</p>

<h2>Increase your chance of winning.</h2> 

<p>
<strong>1 entry for joining.</strong>
All Blyph members will receive one entry into the 2011 reimbursement drawing simply for joining.
</p>  

<p>
<strong>1 entry per book listed.</strong>
Every legitimate course textbook you have listed for trade or sale awards you 1 entry.
</p>

<p>
<strong>100's of entries for inviting friends.</strong>
For every 10 friends that join using your unique link, the value of your links per friend goes up by the value of the 10's of friends who have joined. <strong>Double</strong> the number of friends who join with your link, <strong>Quadruple</strong> the number of entries you have. This way you're always gaining more chances to win than you're adding 'opponents' to the pool. :-D. Now doesn't that kind of math make sense?
<br/>
<br/>10 friends, 10 entries.
<br/>20 friends, 40 entries.
<br/>30 friends, 90 entries.
<br/>40 friends, 160 entries.
