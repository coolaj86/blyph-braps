Brian and I relisted any of the books you had in your 'Need' category from last semester as in the 'Trade/Sell' category for this semester.

Unfortunately, we weren't able to list which books you need for this semester because, well, we're not stalking you.

I know, I know. You feel that we're not showing your the importance you deserve.
However, to make up for not devoting our entire attention to your every waking moment, we're allowing you a simple pleasure instead:



!!!YOU CAN PLAY ASTEROIDS!!!

(spacebar to fire, arrows to move)



Just when you think the fun is over, REFRESH the page and log in.
You'll see last semester's booklist on the left.
You'll notice a "bored?" button on the far right.

Can you guess what happens when you click that button?
Have you ever just wanted to explodinate your books?
Yeah?


And then, just when you think "explodinating last semester's books isn't as fun as it was 10 minutes ago", you realize "hey, I can explodinate next semesters books! W00T!"



NEXT SEMESTER'S BOOKS

So go on and add those books and then show them how you feel.


And then if you're still bored... go grab lunch with some friends at Denny's? mabye... I dunno.
OR EXPLODINATE EVEN MORE BOOKS!!! YEAH!
