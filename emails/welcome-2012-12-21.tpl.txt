Hello new friend and welcome to Blyph.

I hope that you enjoy using Blyph not just because you're saving money, but because
  * you have a moment to meet someone new
  * you can share some pointers about the class you just took
  * (or ask about the one you're about to take),
  * perhaps you'll brighten someone's day with a smile.

May you save all the monies!

P.S. If you actually purchase a book from one of those stores Brian gets between $1 and $5. If enough people purchase from one of those stores, Brian might even give me an allowance to pay for the server 'n stuff. So I do hope that occasionally you buy a book through our retailers because then... I can be RICH!!!
