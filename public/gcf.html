    <h2>This web app requires an HTML5 web browser</h2>

    <p>Sorry, but your version of Internet Explorer is buggy and probably won't work with this application. :(</p>

    <p>You have three options:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Install a web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc)</li>
      <li>Install the ChromeFrame plugin for Internet Explorer</li>
      <li><a href="#" onclick="window.close()">Continue</a> living in a sinful and carnal state devoid of true happiness (but it may not work out very well, so don't say we didn't warn you)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We recommend Chrome on the basis that it takes just a few <em>seconds</em> to install 
    and it's <em>always</em> up-to-date.</p>

    <p>
    Remember, Friends don't let friends use Internet Explorer.
    <br/>
    We're your friends. =-P
    </p>
